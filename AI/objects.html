                <p class="lang-chinese text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    大报恩寺琉璃塔：明成祖恩赐<br><br>

                    🏰 大报恩寺琉璃塔的拱门，1958年在南京中华门外琉璃窑旧址被发现，当时只是一堆残缺的琉璃塔砖件，釉面斑驳。经过精心组装和复原，才得以重现昔日风采。整座塔上五颜六色的琉璃在阳光下闪闪发光，可惜的是，由于战争和动乱，如今只剩下这一套完整的拱门。<br><br>

                    🔮 拱门构件采用高低温釉两次烧造而成，样式繁多，是明代琉璃技术的集大成者。虽然琉璃塔经历了战争的洗礼，最终留给世人的只有南京博物院珍藏的这套完整的“大报恩寺琉璃塔拱门”。但琉璃塔的形象早在19世纪就为外国人所熟知，被认为是世界中古时期的七大奇迹之一。<br><br>

                    🏞️ 大报恩寺琉璃塔共九级八面，通体琉璃，反映了当时大明朝的建筑技术与建筑成就。塔高二十四丈六尺一寸九分，每一层有8个拱券门，九层宝塔除去首层，共有六十四套拱门，每套拱门还烧造了两套备件，总共烧制了一百九十二套华丽的琉璃拱门。此外，每一个拱门的两侧各有一扇小窗户，每扇窗户后面都有一盏长明灯，共一百四十四盏长明灯，当时由百位僧人负责维护，以保证长明灯的不灭。每当夜幕降临，琉璃塔上的长明灯就会亮起，彻夜不熄。<br><br>

                    🏛️ 大报恩寺琉璃塔修建于明朝定都南京期间，历经三代皇帝修了十七年。总设计师是明成祖朱棣，他想报父母恩、报天下恩，决意要建一座通体琉璃的天下第一塔。但在修建过程中，经费不够了，于是郑和被调到南京，调用了下西洋贸易的最后一笔百万银两，并带着他下西洋的一万名水兵参与了琉璃塔的修建。郑和花了六年时间修建琉璃塔，出钱出人，为最后琉璃塔的完工起到了决定性的作用。之后南京有了这座童话般的琉璃塔，使得在明清时代，南京大报恩寺成了欧洲人到中国的必游之地。<br><br>

                    🏰 明成祖朱棣夺取皇位巩固政权后，明朝在这个时间范围内非常强大，既有郑和下西洋的壮举，也有北修故宫南修武当的奇迹。而琉璃塔的匠人们也用“三绝”坐实了第一塔的名声——第一绝高耸云日，第二绝通体琉璃，第三绝佛灯永明——这三绝将琉璃塔推向了中国古代宝塔艺术的最高峰。

                    Big Guanyin Temple's Glass Tower: Granted by Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty<br><br>

                    🏰The arch of the glazed pagoda of the Great Bellen Temple was discovered in 1958 at the site of the glazed kiln outside the southern gate of Nanjing. At that time, it was just a pile of broken glazed pagoda bricks with mottled glaze. After careful assembly and restoration, it could be restored to its former glory. The colorful glazed tiles on the entire pagoda shone in the sunlight, but unfortunately, due to war and turmoil, only this set of complete arches remains today.<br><br>

                    🔮The arch components were made by firing twice at high and low temperatures, and there are many styles. It is the epitome of the Ming Dynasty's glazed tile technology. Although the glazed pagoda has undergone the test of war, the only thing left for the world is the complete set of glazed pagoda arches preserved by the Nanjing Museum. However, the image of the glazed pagoda was known to foreigners as early as the 19th century and was considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Medieval World.<br><br>

                    🏞️The nine-story, eight-sided glazed pagoda of the Great Bellen Temple is entirely made of glazed tiles, reflecting the architectural techniques and achievements of the Great Ming Dynasty. The tower is 24.6 feet tall, with 8 arched doors on each level. Including the first level, there are a total of 64 sets of arched doors on the nine-story pagoda. Each set of arched doors also has two spare sets, making a total of 192 sets of magnificent glazed arched doors. In addition, there are two small windows on each side of each arched door, with a long-burning lamp behind each window. There are a total of 144 long-burning lamps, which were maintained by 100 monks to ensure that the lamps did not go out. At night, the long-burning lamps on the glazed pagoda would light up and burn all night.<br><br>

                    🏛️The Big Bell Tower of the Temple of Great Compassion was built during the Ming Dynasty when Nanjing was the capital, and it took 17 years to complete under the reign of three emperors. The chief designer was Emperor Zhu Di of the Ming Dynasty, who wanted to repay his parents' kindness and the kindness of the world, and decided to build the world's first tower made entirely of glass. However, during the construction process, the funds were insufficient, so Zheng He was transferred to Nanjing, and the last million taels of silver from the trade with Western countries were used. He also brought 10,000 sailors from his trade with Western countries to participate in the construction of the glass tower. Zheng He spent six years building the glass tower, and his money and people played a decisive role in the completion of the glass tower. After that, Nanjing had this fairy-tale glass tower, which made the Temple of Great Compassion in Nanjing a must-visit place for Europeans when they came to China during the Ming and Qing Dynasties.<br><br>

                    🏰After Emperor Zhu Di of the Ming Dynasty took the throne and consolidated his power, the Ming Dynasty was very powerful during this period. There were both Zheng He's voyages to the West and the miracles of repairing the Forbidden City in the north and Wudang Mountain in the south. The craftsmen of the crystal pagoda also solidified the first pagoda's fame with the "Three Wonders": the first wonder was high above the clouds and the sun, the second wonder was entirely made of crystal, and the third wonder was the eternal light of Buddha lamps. These three wonders pushed the crystal pagoda to the pinnacle of ancient Chinese pagoda art.

                <p class="lang-chinese text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    中国青铜鼎（鼎）是中国古代青铜器中非常重要且具有象征意义的器物，主要出现在商朝（约公元前1600年–公元前1046年）和周朝（约公元前1046年–公元前256年）。鼎是一种三足的青铜器，通常用于烹饪、宗教仪式以及作为权力和威严的象征。<br><br>

                    The Chinese Bronze Tripod Cauldron (known as Ding 鼎 in Chinese) is a significant and symbolic piece of ancient Chinese bronze ware, mainly from the Shang Dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BCE) and the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1046–256 BCE). The Ding is a tripod vessel made of bronze, traditionally used for cooking, religious rituals, and as a symbol of power and authority.<br><br>

                    Key Features of the Ding:<br>
	                1.	Design:<br>
	                •	The Ding is a tripod vessel with three legs, elevating the vessel off the ground.<br>
	                •	It typically has two handles for carrying convenience.<br>
	                •	The body of the Ding is often decorated with intricate ritual designs, such as taotie (a mythical animal mask motif), animal figures, and geometric patterns, reflecting the high craftsmanship of the Shang and Zhou periods.<br>
	                2.	Material:<br>
	                •	The Ding is primarily made of bronze, a highly prized material in ancient China for its durability and ability to hold heat. The casting techniques used in making the Ding include piece-mold casting and lost-wax casting.<br>
	                3.	Function:<br>
	                •	The Ding was primarily used for ritual cooking and offerings. In rituals, food (usually meat) was cooked in the Ding and offered to ancestors or deities. This was tied to ancestor worship, a central aspect of ancient Chinese religion and culture.<br>
	                •	Ritual Significance: The Ding was also a symbol of authority. In the Zhou Dynasty, the possession of large Dings was considered a mark of the ruler’s power. The number of Dings a ruler possessed was believed to represent their political and military strength.<br>
	                4.	Cultural Importance:<br>
	                •	The Ding held great symbolic value in ancient Chinese society. During the Zhou Dynasty, the possession of a Ding was considered a mark of legitimate rule. There is a famous saying: “He who possesses the Ding, possesses the Mandate of Heaven,” signifying that the ruler who held the Ding had the divine right to govern.<br>
	                •	Political Symbolism: The transition of power between dynasties was often marked by the handing over of the Ding. The Zhou Dynasty overthrew the Shang Dynasty, and the transfer of the Ding symbolized this power shift.<br>
	                5.	Size and Varieties:<br>
	                •	The Ding came in various sizes. Smaller ones were used for domestic rituals, while larger ones were used for royal or state ceremonies.<br>
	                •	Some large Dings could weigh several tons, and the most famous examples are the “Three Dings” associated with the rulers of the Zhou Dynasty.<br>
	                6.	Famous Dings:<br>
	                •	The Song Ding: An important Ding from the Zhou period, known for its impressive size and craftsmanship.<br>
	                •	The Fuxi Ding: A famous Ding associated with the mythical Chinese emperor Fuxi.<br>
	                •	The Ding of King Wu: A highly significant artifact related to the founder of the Zhou Dynasty, King Wu.<br><br>

                    Archaeological Discovery:<br>
	                •	Numerous Dings have been found in tombs and archaeological sites across China. These discoveries provide valuable insight into the religious and political practices of ancient Chinese societies. The Ding is often regarded as a national treasure and is displayed in museums both in China and internationally.<br><br>

                    Legacy:<br>
	                •	The legacy of the Ding extends beyond its historical and religious significance. It is widely regarded as a symbol of Chinese culture and appears frequently in Chinese art, literature, and symbolism. In modern times, the Ding remains a cultural icon, sometimes referenced in Chinese politics and culture as a symbol of power and tradition.
